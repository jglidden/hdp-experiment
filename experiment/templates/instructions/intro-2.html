<p>Below is an example of a biological taxonomy. The categories are arranged in a tree structure, with arrows indicating the parent-child relationships between them.

<p>An arrow points froma  parent category to a child category. Each child category is a specialization or restriction of its parent category. In other words, every object that belongs to a child category also belongs to the parent category, with occasional exceptions.

<p>For example, an oak is a kind of tree, a tree is kind of plant and a plant is a kind of organism.
