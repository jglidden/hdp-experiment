<p>Now you will be shown objects belonging to 10 categories which are organized in a taxonomical system. You will first learn to differentiate between all 10 categories.

<p>On each page you will be shown an object and a category. You will be asked whether the displayed object is belongs to the accompanying category. At first this will be difficult, but as you gather information, your performance will improve. After each information-gathering session you will be asked to reconstruct the taxonomical system that the categories belong to.

<p>The task will be divided into _sessions_. Each session is divided into {{block_count}} _blocks_. Each block is divided into {{block_size}} _items_. After each block you may take a 5 minute break. Your block and item progress is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. You may complete a maximum of one session per day. At the end of each session you will be asked to diagram the relationship between concepts. The task ends when a sufficient accuracy is achieved.
