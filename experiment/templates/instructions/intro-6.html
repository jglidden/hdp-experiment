<p>In cases where there are little or no relationships between categories, the taxonomical system contains taxonomies that are just individual categories without any arrows connecting them. Here, we know that "asparagus" is a subset of vegetable, but "aspirin", "architect" and "violin" are all unrelated to the other categories, so there are no arrows between them.
