<p>Now you will be shown objects belonging to 10 categories which are organized in a taxonomical system. You will first learn to differentiate between all 10 categories.

<p>On each page you will be shown an object and a category. You will be asked whether the displayed object belongs to the accompanying category. The categories are imaginary and you will not know any of the categorizations at the outset. At first this will be difficult, but as you gather information, your performance will improve. After each information-gathering session you will be asked to reconstruct the taxonomical system that the categories belong to.

<p>The task will be divided into daily sessions which will last about an hour. You will have the opportunity to take breaks within a session. You may complete a maximum of one session per day. At the end of each session you will be asked to diagram the relationship between concepts.
