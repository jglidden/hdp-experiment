#Experiment instructions

###Imagine that you are an anthropologist who has just landed on a previously undiscovered island.

The inhabitants speak a strange language consisting of three letter words. Your goal is to characterize some of the concepts in this language by asking them questions about series of objects around the island.

In the following pages:
        + A _concept_ is a  three letter word like this: <big>**con**</big>
        + An _object_ is an image like this: <img src={{img}} height=200 width=200>

Your ultimate goal is to reconstruct the taxonomical system for the concepts you encounter. This system will be a _hierarchal_ (tree) structure which you will ultimately be asked to draw.

On each page you will be shown an object and a concept. You will be asked whether the displayed object is an example of the indicated concept. At first this will be difficult, but as you gather information, your performance will improve. After each information-gathering session you will be asked to draw the taxonomy.
 
The task will be divided into _sessions_. Each session is divided into {{block_count}} _blocks_. Each block is divided into {{block_size}} _items_. After each block you may take a 5 minute break. Your block and item progress is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. You may complete a maximum of one session per day. At the end of each session you will be asked to diagram the relationship between concepts. The task ends when a sufficient accuracy is achieved.

#Tree drawing instructions

###Please reconstruct the taxonomical system for the concepts you have learned

Your task is to diagram the relationship between the concepts you have learned
For every concept, draw an arrow to every other concept which is contained within it. That is, <b>draw an arrow from concept A to concept B if "every B is an A"</b>. Remember, the structure is a hiearchy.
